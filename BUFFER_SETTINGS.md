# Enhanced Audio Buffering Configuration

## Overview

Your Tunio Radio Player has been enhanced with advanced buffering settings similar to YouTube's buffering strategy. These improvements provide better stability and reduce interruptions during streaming.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Extended Buffer Sizes
- **Minimum Buffer**: 30 seconds (was default ~2-5 seconds)
- **Maximum Buffer**: 2 minutes (was default ~10-15 seconds)
- **Target Buffer Size**: 5MB for better quality maintenance

### 2. Smart Playback Control
- **Initial Playback Start**: After 2 seconds of buffering
- **Resume After Rebuffering**: After 5 seconds of buffer recovery
- **Forward Buffer**: 1 minute ahead (iOS/macOS)
- **Back Buffer**: 10 seconds retained for smooth seeking

### 3. Platform-Specific Optimizations

#### Android (ExoPlayer)
- Prioritizes time-based thresholds over size
- Uses intelligent load control
- Optimized for streaming vs local playback

#### iOS/macOS (AVPlayer)
- Automatically waits to minimize stalling
- Continues downloading while paused for live streams
- Peak bitrate limitation (320 kbps) for stability

### 4. Network Optimizations
- Enhanced HTTP headers for better server compatibility
- Improved User-Agent for streaming identification
- Better connection management

## Technical Details

### Buffer Configuration Files
- `lib/utils/audio_config.dart` - Centralized buffer settings
- `lib/services/audio_service.dart` - Implementation

### Key Settings
```dart
// Buffer durations
minBufferDuration: 30 seconds
maxBufferDuration: 120 seconds
bufferForPlaybackDuration: 2 seconds
bufferForPlaybackAfterRebufferDuration: 5 seconds

// Quality settings
targetBufferBytes: 5MB
maxBitRate: 320 kbps
```

### Buffer Status Monitoring
The app now shows real-time buffer status:
- **Green indicator**: Healthy buffer (30+ seconds)
- **Orange indicator**: Low buffer (10-30 seconds)
- **Red warning**: Critical buffer (<10 seconds)

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Interruptions**: Larger buffers mean fewer pauses due to network hiccups
2. **Better Quality**: Maintains consistent audio quality even on variable connections
3. **Smarter Recovery**: Faster recovery from network issues
4. **Visual Feedback**: Users can see buffer health in real-time

## Customization

You can adjust buffer settings in `lib/utils/audio_config.dart`:

```dart
// For even more aggressive buffering (uses more memory/data)
static const Duration minBufferDuration = Duration(seconds: 60);
static const Duration maxBufferDuration = Duration(seconds: 180);

// For lighter buffering (less memory usage)
static const Duration minBufferDuration = Duration(seconds: 15);
static const Duration maxBufferDuration = Duration(seconds: 60);
```

## Memory and Data Usage

- **Memory Impact**: ~5-10MB additional RAM usage for buffering
- **Data Usage**: Minimal increase due to intelligent pre-buffering
- **Battery**: Slight increase due to continuous buffering monitoring

## Compatibility

- ✅ Android 5.0+ (API 21+)
- ✅ iOS 12.0+
- ✅ macOS 10.14+
- ✅ All network types (WiFi, Mobile Data, Ethernet)

This implementation provides YouTube-like streaming reliability while maintaining efficient resource usage.
